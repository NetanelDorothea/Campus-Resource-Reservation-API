# Campus-Resource-Reservation-API

Project Scope and System Description
The Campus Resource Reservation API (CRRA) is responsible for the management of reservable campus resources such as study rooms, lab spaces, shared facilities, and equipment. Through the CRRA, users are able to view available resources, manage reservations (crud), enforce access rules, and handle errors and system events reliably. This system will not handle payment processing.

Technology Confirmation
Using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and Github are important for a course like this, because it ensures consistency, fairness, and manageable grading. Additionally, these tools make sure the back-end is manageable and working. Node.js and Express.js are used to build fast and scalable network applications, while MySQL is used to store information in databases and manage them. Github provides version control and efficient collaboration within teams.
